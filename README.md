# Blackmarlin

WIP XBoard Chess Engine

Blackmarlin is a chess engine fully written in Rust.

Make sure to compile the chess engine with `cargo build --release --features standard` or run it with `cargo run --release --features standard` in order to get the maximum strength out of the engine.

In order to access experimental features that aren't yet used, use `experimental` instead of `standard` when building.
